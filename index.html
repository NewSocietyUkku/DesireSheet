What is this document?
</b>



<br>
<br>


This document is a list that lists all the desires/sufferings which are experienced by us people. It’s assumed that happiness is achieved by removing these sufferings. When these sufferings exists, they are like empty holes that need to be filled. People’s behavior will be governed by the act of trying to fill these holes. Therefore, understanding this list allows you to understand and predict the behavior of people. People do things for a reason and all their reasons are only an extension of these sufferings/holes that need to be filled.

<br>
<br>


This list is a rough draft by the author. It needs to be scrutinised and modified, in order to get a truly accurate list. However, it allows the reader to get a basic idea of what a [basic desire sheet] would look like in real life.

<br>
<br>

It should also be noted that gains and sufferings can be experienced before the loss/gain occurs. For example, I can tell someone that I have a nice chocolate treat for them and their happiness will increase due to their food suffering increased in the future. This has happened before the food to treat the suffering was received. Furthermore, the disappointment will create suffering if they were to be expecting the food and after waiting, never to receive it.

<br>
<br>


Therefore one should take into account how expectations affect these sufferings.

<b>Terminology</b>

<br>
<br>


In this document you will read the term [life’s focus]. When we day dream, we are conducting science. A scientist will discover truth by conducting various testing and following a method for obtaining data from these experiments. A similar thing happens in our heads when we day dream. We test out our relationship to different sufferings, which evolve into fantasies. By the process of removing, adding and modifying our fantasies, we build a mental road-map to get from where we are to where we want to be. This blinds us from seeing the world as it is. Instead, we see it through glasses tinted by biases: biases that views/analysis the world in terms of achieving our own desires, rather than how it is.

<br>
<br>


When this document refers to [life’s focus], it refers to the [life’s focus] that one should ideally have. A person who fails to day dream will fail to to develop fantasies appropriate to their internal desires. Therefore, they will chase the artificial fantasies of others. When this document talks about something being in line with a person’s [life’s focus] it is referring to the ideal [life’s focus] that a person would have, if they spent enough time day dreaming, as to develop appropriate fantasies. It does not refer to the artificial fantasies imposed by others, that exist, only when one fails to develop their own. 

<br>
<br>


The reason for this distinction is that a [life’s focus] that is developed by the fantasies of other’s, is volatile. It may change when someone tries to pursue it and will leave the person unfulfilled. Therefore, it is uncertain if these fantasies would be applicable to the parts referring to the [life’s focus] in this document.

<br>
<br>



[drive/focus] is a term used to refer to the work/actions that one is driven/motivated to do/take, by the mental road-map of their [life’s focus].

<br>
